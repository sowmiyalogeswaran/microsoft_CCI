###Microsoft: Classifying Cybersecurity Incidents with Machine Learning

##Project Overview
The Microsoft: Classifying Cybersecurity Incidents project leverages machine learning to optimize the efficiency of Security Operations Centers (SOCs) at Microsoft. This initiative focuses on building a robust classification model to predict the triage grade of cybersecurity incidents, enabling analysts to prioritize and address threats effectively.

##Incident Categories
The incidents are classified into:
True Positive (TP): A confirmed security threat.
Benign Positive (BP): A false alarm.
False Positive (FP): A misidentified threat.

##Key Features & Skills
This project integrates several vital aspects of data science and machine learning:
Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering: Cleaning, transforming, and creating features for effective model building.
Machine Learning Models: Implementing Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and others.
Evaluation Metrics: Using Macro-F1 Score, Precision, and Recall to assess model performance.
Imbalanced Data Handling: Addressing skewed class distributions with techniques like SMOTE and class weighting.
Hyperparameter Optimization: Enhancing performance via Randomized Search and Cross-Validation.
Cybersecurity Insights: Leveraging frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK to contextualize predictions.

##Business Use Cases
This project addresses several critical areas in cybersecurity:
Security Operations Centers (SOCs): Automates triage, reducing analysts' workload and improving threat prioritization.
Threat Intelligence: Enhances the accuracy of threat detection and reduces false alarms.
Incident Response: Enables faster and more informed responses to potential security events.
Enterprise Security Management: Supports data-driven decisions for enhanced organizational security.
