###Microsoft: Classifying Cybersecurity Incidents with Machine Learning
Project Overview
The Microsoft: Classifying Cybersecurity Incidents project harnesses machine learning to enhance the efficiency of Security Operations Centers (SOCs) at Microsoft. This project focuses on building a high-performing classification model to predict the triage grade of cybersecurity incidents, helping analysts prioritize threats and respond effectively.

The incidents are categorized as:

True Positive (TP): A confirmed threat.
Benign Positive (BP): A false alarm.
False Positive (FP): A misidentified threat.
Key Features & Skills
This project demonstrates core aspects of data science and machine learning, including:

Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering: Cleaning, transforming, and selecting relevant features for model building.
Classification Algorithms: Implementing models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
Evaluation Metrics: Focusing on Macro-F1 Score, Precision, and Recall to ensure reliable performance.
Imbalanced Data Handling: Addressing class imbalance using techniques like SMOTE and class weighting.
Hyperparameter Optimization: Enhancing model performance with Randomized Search and Cross-Validation.
Cybersecurity Insights: Aligning with frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK to contextualize findings.
Business Use Cases
The solution offers significant improvements to:

Security Operations Centers (SOCs): Automating incident triage to reduce workload and improve focus on real threats.
Threat Intelligence: Enhancing detection accuracy and reducing false positives.
Incident Response: Enabling faster and more informed responses to critical security events.
